# Issues
- Struggling with getting a random array
- Button wasn't working. Had it inside main so it was constantly resetting everytime my function would run, essentially sending into loop hell.
---

## Side Notes
- The character "Antenna Rick" isn't bugged, that's just the default character image that was supplied.
